# Factory_Steel
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kimond/factory_steel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kimond/factory_steel)

Factory-steel is a fixture replacement greatly inspired by [factory_bot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot)
and [factory_boy](https://github.com/FactoryBoy/factory_boy). Currently it is an experimental project. 
Although usable, it is still very limited in term of features and reliability.
